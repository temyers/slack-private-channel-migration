### Terraform

This project requires some resources configured using Terraform.

To run the infrastructure:

`docker-compose run --rm terraform`

```
> cd infrastructure
> terraform plan
> terraform apply
```

### Dev environment

A Docker development environment is provided:

```
docker-compose build dev-env
docker-compose run --rm dev-env
```

Install dependencies
```
>yarn install
```

### Running Tests:

Run unit tests:
```
npm run test
```

Run integration & acceptance tests
```
export SOURCE_TEAM_TOKEN_integration=xoxp-123456789012-123456789012-123456789012-123456789012abcdef1234567890abcd
npm run test_it
npm run test_accept
```

### Serverless WebPack Integration
To invoke the webpack bundled function locally
```
serverless webpack invoke --function [your function name]
```

To bundle the function
```
serverless webpack
```
Bundled assets will be created in **.webpack** folder

More information can be found [here](https://github.com/elastic-coders/serverless-webpack). Not all third party modules can be bundled. Look on [this](https://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#externals) webpack configuration on externals to exclude modules.

When you do **serverless deploy** , it will deploy the bundled assets.

Deploy to dev:
```
npm run deploy:dev
```

##### Clone the Repo

```
git clone {{repo}}
```
